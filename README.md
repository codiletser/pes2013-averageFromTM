Script to get updated player averages from Transfermarkt. For older Pro Evolution Soccer games.
Author: codiletser

To view the averages of each player for PES, you must have previously installed the Tampermonkey extension (https://www.tampermonkey.net/) in your favorite browser.

You only have to add to the extension the file  
Overall Pro Evolution Soccer-1.3.user.js to install it.

This visualization is only available for https://www.transfermarkt.com/ (Be careful that it has the ".com" because in other regions they use different formats that make the correct calculation impossible).
